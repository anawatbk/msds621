    "# Computing gini impurity\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees use the gini impurity index as a measure of uncertainty; it is like entropy except faster to compute because it does not involve logarithms. Given a list of $k$ probabilities for a $k$-class classification problem, gini impurity gives a value between 0 and $(k - 1)/k$. For the common case of binary classification ($k=2$), gini impurity is between 0 and 0.5. Here is the formula given a vector of probabilities for each class:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Gini({\\bf p}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i \\left[ \\sum_{j \\ne i}^k p_j \\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i (1 - p_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i - \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i^2 = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p_i = \\frac{|y[y==i]|}{|y|}$. Since $\\sum_{j \\ne i}^k p_j$ is the probability of \"not $p_i$\", we can summarize that as just $1-p_i$. The gini value is then computing $p_i$ times \"not $p_i$\" for $k$ classes.  Value $p_i$ is the probability of seeing class $i$ in a list of target values, $y$. "

    "## Range of gini impurity\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum value occurs when exactly one $p_i$ has nonzero probability, which must mean $p_i=1.0$. The gini impurity is then 1-1 = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum value occurs when there is maximum uncertainty, which would mean all probabilities are equal (and sum to 1.0): $p_i = p_j ~\\forall ~i \\neq j$.  Equal probabilities for $k$ classes means that $p_i = 1/k$ and therefore $1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i^2 = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{k} 1/k^2 = 1 - k/k^2 = 1 - 1/k = (k-1)/k$.  The maximum value of that is when $1/k$ is at its smallest, which is when $k$ it gets really big. As $k$ gets bigger, $1/k$ goes to 0, leaving the maximum gini impurity as 1-0 = 1. You can see from the following iterations that the more classes we have, the smaller the second term becomes very small for large $k$:"
